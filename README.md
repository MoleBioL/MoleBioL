Hello I am MoleBioL, I graduate from NTNU, Life Science Department.
I had been in academia sinica since junior in university. At that time I am major in molecular biology research.
However, after graduation, I want to try another career so I start my teaching career. 
Therefore I have been to Taitung for one year, teaching biology in Jun-Yi high school. It's a experimental school, everthing is different there. 
I try many different career, and then as AI become the trend, now I start a new adventure.
Nice to meet you
